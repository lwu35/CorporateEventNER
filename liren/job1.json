Gundermann, the Company’s President and CEO, commented, “As we expected, our first quarter was a slow start to the year. However, our Aerospace bookings continue to recover, increasing 36% sequentially from the fourth quarter, resulting in our first positive Aerospace book-to-bill ratio of 1.23 since the pandemic began over a year ago. We are encouraged that the industry seems poised for recovery as the pandemic comes under control.”\n\nFirst Quarter Summary and Review of Major Markets\n\nFirst quarter revenue was $105.9 million, down 32.8% from the comparator period of 2020. The Company incurred a net loss of $11.9 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.5 million, or 0.5% of sales.\n\nThe Company evaluates three revenue streams to monitor demand and analyze the impact of the pandemic to its business. These are (1) the commercial aircraft market, which includes OEM line fit and airline aftermarket business, (2) defense and other government markets, and (3) general aviation.\n\nCommercial aerospace continues to be heavily impacted by the pandemic and was\n$38.2 million, or 36% of total revenue in the quarter, compared with $102.8 million, or 65% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2020. Narrow body aircraft build rates are expected to improve through 2021 from current levels as production of the 737 MAX picks up. The aftermarket is expected to strengthen over the course of the year as aircraft utilization and load factors increase.\nDefense and government markets, including our military aircraft sales and test segment sales*, have remained strong through the pandemic. Sales to these markets were\n$45.4 million, or 43% of first quarter revenue in 2021, up from $33.0 million, or 21% in the comparator period of 2020.\nGeneral aviation sales were $14.0 million, representing about 13% of first quarter revenue in 2021. This compares with $15.0 million, or 10% of revenue in the comparator period. Most of general aviation revenue is line fit production driven by the manufacture of new aircraft, although there is some amount of aftermarket business as well. Demand for private aircraft has recovered quickly and is expected to result in higher aircraft production rates in the near future.\nOther revenue was about 8% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2021.\n* Test segment sales discussed in Defense and Government markets for 2020 excludes sales to the semiconductor industry.\n\nLiquidity and Financing\n\nIn May 2020, the Company executed an amendment to its credit agreement (the “amended facility”) which reduced the revolving credit line from $500 million to $375 million. The amended facility suspended the application of the maximum net leverage ratio covenant up through and including the second quarter of 2021. The maximum net leverage ratio on a trailing twelve-month basis will resume at 6.00 to 1 for the third quarter of 2021, 5.50 to 1 for the fourth quarter of 2021, 4.50 to 1 for the first quarter of 2022, and return to 3.75 to 1 in the second quarter of 2022 and thereafter. As of April 3, 2021, the Company had $173.0 million drawn on the facility, with net debt of $142.3 million.\n\nIn addition, through the second quarter of 2021, other financial covenants require the Company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 1.75x on a quarterly basis, except for the first quarter of 2021, which was set at 1.50x. Also, through the third quarter of 2021, the Company must maintain minimum liquidity, defined as unrestricted cash plus the unused revolving credit commitments, of $180 million at all times. The amended facility also temporarily restricts certain activities, including acquisitions and share repurchases, and requires mandatory prepayments during the suspension period when the Company’s cash balance exceeds $100 million.\n\nCash used in operations totaled $6.9 million in the first quarter. The Company was compliant with its debt covenants as of the end of the first quarter and expects to remain compliant.\n\nIn February 2021, the Company was notified by the acquirer of its semiconductor business, which was sold in February 2019, that $10.7 million is payable to the Company for earnouts related to 2020. In April 2021, the acquirer provided a revised calculation, indicating, rather, that\n\n$7.1 million is payable to the Company for the 2020 earnout. The Company is currently reviewing the calculations and underlying data and expects to record the additional gain on the sale when that review is complete and the issue resolved.\n\nFirst Quarter Results\n\n \n\nThree Months Ended\n\n($ in thousands)\n\nApril 3, 2021\n\n \n\nMarch 28, 2020\n\n% Change\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSales\n\n$\n\n105,857\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n157,584\n\n \n\n(32.8)\n\n%\n\nLoss from Operations\n\n$\n\n(9,512)\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n(67,556)\n\n \n\n(85.9)\n\n%\n\nOperating Margin %\n\n(9.0)\n\n%\n\n \n\n(42.9)\n\n%\n\n \n\nNet Loss\n\n$\n\n(11,909)\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n(66,963)\n\n \n\n(82.2)\n\n%\n\nNet Loss %\n\n(11.3)\n\n%\n\n \n\n(42.5)\n\n%\n\n \n\n*Adjusted EBITDA\n\n$\n\n(496)\n\n \n\n \n\n$\n\n16,763\n\n \n\n(103.0)\n\n%\n\n*Adjusted EBITDA Margin %\n\n(0.5)\n\n%\n\n \n\n10.6\n\n%\n\n \n\n*Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP Performance Measure. Please see the attached table for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income.\n\nFirst Quarter 2021 Results (compared with the prior-year period, unless noted otherwise)\n\nConsolidated sales were down $51.7 million. Aerospace sales were down $59.7 million from the 2020 first quarter, which had been largely unaffected by the COVID pandemic. Test System sales increased $7.9 million.\n\nConsolidated operating loss was $9.5 million, compared with operating loss of $67.6 million in the prior-year period. The loss in the first quarter of 2021 was due to low volume related to the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global aerospace industry. The prior-year period reflected non-cash goodwill and other asset impairment charges of $74.4 million in the aerospace segment due to revised expectations regarding future operating results as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold.\n\nConsolidated net loss was $11.9 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $67.0 million, or $2.17 per diluted share, in the prior year. The after-tax impact of the prior year impairment was $68.8 million, or $2.23 per diluted share.\n\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA loss was $0.5 million, or 0.5% of consolidated sales, compared with adjusted EBITDA of $16.8 million, or 10.6% of consolidated sales, in the prior-year period.\n\nBookings were $120.0 million resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.13:1. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $297.5 million. Approximately $217.2 million, or 73%, of backlog is expected to ship in the remainder of 2021.\n\nAerospace Segment Review (refer to sales by market and segment data in accompanying tables)\n\nAerospace First Quarter 2021 Results (compared with the prior-year period, unless noted otherwise)\n\nAerospace segment sales decreased $59.7 million, or 42.3%, to $81.4 million. Sales continued to be negatively affected by low commercial aircraft build rates and a weak commercial aircraft aftermarket as airlines have reduced spending and grounded aircraft due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAerospace segment operating loss was $5.6 million compared with operating loss of $63.1 million for the same period last year. Leverage lost on reduced sales significantly impacted operating results. Aerospace operating profit in the prior-year period was impacted by goodwill and other asset impairment charges of $74.4 million, as previously discussed.\n\nAerospace bookings in the first quarter of 2021 improved sequentially by 36%, to $100.5 million, for a book-to-bill ratio for the quarter of 1.23:1. Backlog was $210.2 million at the end of the first quarter of 2021.\n\nTest Systems Segment Review (refer to sales by market and segment data in accompanying tables)\n\nTest Systems First Quarter 2021 Results (compared with the prior-year period, unless noted otherwise)\n\nTest Systems segment sales were $24.4 million, up $7.9 million compared with the prior-year period.\n\nTest Systems operating profit was $1.2 million, or 4.9% of sales, compared with $0.7 million, or 4.4% of sales, in the first quarter of 2020. Operating profit in the first quarter of 2021 was negatively affected by $0.9 million in legal fees related to infringement claims. Operating results in 2020 benefited from $1.6 million in semiconductor warranty revenue.\n\nBookings for the Test Systems segment in the quarter were $19.5 million, for a book-to-bill ratio of 0.80:1 for the quarter. Backlog was $87.4 million at the end of the first quarter of 2021.\n\n2021 Outlook\n\nMr. Gundermann commented, “We are pleased with the continued strong demand for our Test business, which had core sales up 64% over last year. We also are encouraged by the consistent sequential ramping of Aerospace bookings since the second quarter of last year. We are optimistic that demand will strengthen as 2021 progresses, but it is too early to forecast results confidently. However, we expect our revenue in the second quarter to be about $115 million. Our goals remain to generate cash and reduce debt. Evidence suggests that our largest market, which is dependent upon the health of the commercial airline industry, will recover when and where the pandemic comes under control. While we are making strides in the U.S., we look forward to progress in this regard worldwide through the remainder of this year.”\n\nOur expectation for capital expenditures for 2021 remain unchanged at approximately $10 million to $11 million.\n\nFirst Quarter 2021 Webcast and Conference Call\n\nThe Company will host a teleconference today at 11:00 a.m. ET.

The Company’s management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare the performance of its core operations from period to period by removing the impact of the capital structure (interest), tangible and intangible asset base (depreciation and amortization), taxes, equity-based compensation expense, goodwill, intangible and long-lived asset impairment charges, equity investment income or loss, legal reserves, settlements and recoveries, restructuring charges and gains or losses associated with the sale of businesses, which is not commensurate with the core activities of the reporting period in which it is included. As such, the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of performance when evaluating its business and as a basis for planning and forecasting. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and is not calculated through the application of GAAP. As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of net income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.\n\nASTRONICS

Forward‐looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Forward‐looking statements include those regarding operating trends,\nfuture results of operations, and the timing and completion of the Company’s construction and growth projects. Because forward‐looking statements relate to the future, they\nare subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the control of Full House. Additional\ninformation concerning potential factors that could affect Full House’s financial condition and results of operations is included in the reports Full House files with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, its Form 10‐K for the most recently ended fiscal year and the Company’s other periodic reports filed with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission. The Company is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update or revise its forward‐looking statements as a result of\nnew information, future events or otherwise. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward‐looking statements.\nThis presentation also includes non‐GAAP financial measures as defined in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulation G. A reconciliation of these non‐GAAP financial\nmeasures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available on our website at www.fullhouseresorts.com in the earnings release for the applicable periods..\nWe define “Adjusted EBITDA” as earnings before interest and other non‐operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, asset write‐offs,\nrecoveries, gain (loss) from asset disposals, board and executive transition costs, pre‐opening expenses, project development and acquisition costs, and non‐cash share‐based\ncompensation expense. “Adjusted Property EBITDA” is Adjusted EBITDA before corporate related costs and expenses which are not allocated to each property. Although Adjusted\nEBITDA and Adjusted Property EBITDA are not measures of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we believe\nthese non‐GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity. We utilize Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Property\nEBITDA internally to focus management on year‐over‐year changes in our core operating performance, which we consider our ordinary, ongoing and customary operations and\nwhich we believe is useful information to investors. Accordingly, management excludes certain items when analyzing core operating performance, such as the items mentioned\nabove, that management believes are not reflective of ordinary, ongoing and customary operations.\nIn addition, because Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Property EBITDA are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures employed by other companies. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Property EBITDA is presented below. However, you should not consider these\nmeasures in isolation or as substitutes for operating income, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure for determining our operating performance or liquidity\nthat is calculated in accordance with GAAP. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In\nevaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Property EBITDA, you should be aware that, in the future, we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the\nadjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Property EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be\nunaffected by unusual or non‐recurring items"],"_clicks":["http://investors.fullhouseresorts.com/news-event/presentations"]},"unit_data":{"url_id":"2","url":"http://investors.fullhouseresorts.com/news-event/presentations"}}]}}

If you don't have the news release that crossed the wire after markets closed\nyesterday, that can be found in our website at transcat.com. The slides that accompany today's\ndiscussion are also on our website.\nIf you would, please refer to Slide 2. As you are aware, we may make forward-looking statements during\nthe formal presentation and Q&A portion of this teleconference. Those statements apply to future events,\nwhich are subject to risks and uncertainties, as well as other factors that could cause the actual results to\ndiffer materially from where we are today. These factors are outlined in the news release as well as with\ndocuments filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You can find those on\nour website where we regularly post information about the company as well as on the SEC's website at\nsec.gov.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update or correct any of the forward-looking statements contained\nin this call whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nPlease review our forward-looking statements in conjunction with these precautionary factors.\nI'd like to point out as well that during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we\nbelieve will be useful in evaluating our performance. You should not consider the presentation of this\nadditional information in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We\nhave provided reconciliations of non-GAAP to comparable GAAP measures in the tables accompanying\nthe earnings release.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Lee to begin the discussion. Lee?\nLee Rudow: Thank you, Craig. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today.\nWithout question, our team is pleased with the fourth quarter results and the results for the full fiscal\n2021 year. In both the fourth quarter and full fiscal 2021, we generated record revenue, record operating\nincome, record service margins and record cash flow.\nThe company fought through the challenges of the pandemic and demonstrated both the inherent\nresiliency of the business and the adaptability of our dedicated team. Our performance underscores the\nvalue of our services and validates the investments we've made in technology, infrastructure and the\ntalent needed to effectively execute our strategic plan, especially this past year.\nOur Service segment continues to be our primary growth engine. The segment generated strong growth\nacross every financial metric. And in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we returned to double-digit organic\nrevenue growth. It was our 48th straight quarter of service growth and resulted in Transcat passing the\n$100 million annual service revenue mark for service for the first time.\nIn addition to service revenue growth, we delivered outstanding service margin performance. Gross\nmargins were up 500 basis points in the fourth quarter to 33.9%. And for the first time, our full year\nservice gross margin achieved a milestone of 30%.\nOperating margin was up 470 basis points in the fourth quarter to 15.1%. Margin gains were primarily\ndriven by technician productivity, inherent operating leverage on organic service revenue growth and\naccretive acquisitions of pipettes.com and BioTek. Distribution was still impacted by the lingering effect of\nthe pandemic, though we're encouraged by the sequential improvement in the business as distribution\nturned in its best quarterly results of fiscal 2021. \nTranscat, Inc.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Financial Results\nMay 19, 2021\nPage 2 of 9\nThe rental business continues to perform well, up 11% in the fourth quarter. Overall, our fourth quarter\noperating income exceeded our expectations, hitting $4.5 million, up 21%. Even with the downward\npressure caused by the pandemic, operating income for the full year hit a record $11.1 million.\nWe generated record cash flow of $23.6 million during the year. Cash was primarily allocated to support\nour acquisition strategy, technology investments and to pay down debt by $10.7 million.\nOur current leverage ratio is now below 1, which provides us flexibility to capitalize on future organic\ngrowth opportunities and margin-enhancing technology developments to drive automation and process\nimprovement into our operation. And of course, our balance sheet will aid in the execution of our next\nlevel acquisition strategy.\nBefore I turn things over to Mark, though, I want to walk through an announced acquisition we made on\nApril 29. We acquired Upstate Metrology, a small bolt-on acquisition located nearby our headquarters in\nRochester, New York. Upstate Metrology's annual revenue is approximately $1 million. But as a bolt-on,\nit'll be integrated very quickly with our Rochester-based calibration lab, so we can fully leverage our\ncurrent infrastructure.\nAnd with that, Mark, I'll turn things over to you.\nMark Doheny: Thanks, Lee, and good morning, everyone. I will start on Slide 4 of our earnings deck,\nwhich provides detail regarding our revenue for the fourth quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter,\nconsolidated revenue of nearly $49 million was up 7% on strong service revenue and sequentially\nimproving distribution revenue.\nTurning to the segments. As we mentioned, we were very pleased with Service segment revenue growth\nof approximately 16%, with 10% organic growth and 6% coming from acquisitions. The strong organic\ngrowth was mainly driven by improving order trends and continued market share gains, and to a lesser\ndegree, by an easier comparison to the prior year quarter as the Service business began to feel the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic towards the second half of March 2020. With regard to the acquisition\ngrowth, we have now lapped the 1-year anniversary of our acquisition of pipettes.com, which was\nacquired in February 2020. With that in mind, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, pipettes.com\nwill fully become part of our base business.\nTurning to distribution. Segment sales of $19.8 million were down approximately 5% from prior year, the\nbest quarterly comparison of fiscal year 2021. Sales improved 3% sequentially from our fiscal third\nquarter on modestly improving income trends, especially for products sold into the wind power\ngeneration market. As a reminder, we did not feel the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on distribution\nrevenue until early April of last year as we continue to shift out of our backlog through the end of March\n2020.\nFinally, on a full year basis, we were very happy to set a new revenue record of $173.3 million, which\nwas up slightly from the prior year. Our Service business was up a healthy 9%, and as Lee mentioned,\nsurpassed the $100 million milestone revenue mark. This more than offset the distribution decline of\napproximately 10%.\nTurning to Slide 5. Our fourth quarter consolidated gross profit was up 16% from prior year, and our\ngross margin expanded 230 basis points to 28.6%. Service segment gross margin was up 500 basis\npoints to 33.9% on continued traction from our technician productivity initiatives, operating leverage from\norganic growth, and accretive margins from our recent acquisitions. Fourth quarter distribution gross\nmargin was down 220 basis points from prior year on lower levels of co-op advertising and rebates from\nour vendors.\nFor the full year, our consolidated gross profit increased 9% to $46.1 million. And also, as Lee mentioned\nearlier, we achieved an important milestone of over 30% gross margin on our service business for the\nyear. We believe this level of gross margin is largely sustainable as the majority of the year-over-year \nTranscat, Inc.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Financial Results\nMay 19, 2021\nPage 3 of 9\nimprovement we saw in fiscal 2021 has been driven by technician productivity and operating leverage on\nour fixed costs.\nTurning to Slide 6 for our overall operating performance. Fourth quarter consolidated operating income\nof $4.5 million was up 21% from prior year and exceeded our expectations. Service segment operating\nincome increased to $1.8 million, and operating margin increased 470 basis points as a significant\nportion of the gross profit increase fell through to operating income.\nDistribution operating income was down approximately $1 million, largely on lower gross profits.\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter included incremental expense from our recent acquisitions,\nhigher technology spend as well as approximately $300,000 in severance expense.\nTurning to Slide 7. Q4 net income increased 29% to $3.2 million, and our diluted earnings per share of\n$0.42 were up $0.11 from prior year, a result of the strong operating performance. For the full year, net\nincome was down 3% and diluted earnings per share were down $0.05. The fiscal 2021 tax rate of\n21.9% was up 470 basis points from the fiscal 2020 tax rate, which was aided by a higher discrete\nincome tax benefits.\nMoving to Slide 8, where we show our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. Among other\nmeasures, we used adjusted EBITDA, which is non-GAAP to gauge the performance of our segments\nbecause we believe it is a good measure of our operating performance and ability to generate cash. A\nreconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to operating and net income can be found in the supplemental section\nof this presentation which, as a reminder, is posted on our website.\nFourth quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA was up 30%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin increased\nto 15%. We were especially pleased with the Service segments increase of $2.4 million, which drove\nEBITDA margin up to 21.7% in the quarter. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was up 12% and driven by\nService segment EBITDA margin expansion to a healthy 16.8%.\nMoving to Slide 9 and our cash flow. Full year net cash provided by operations doubled from the prior\nyear to $23.6 million and was a function of our improved EBITDA and reductions to working capital.\nFull year CapEx was $6.6 million, and were largely focused on technology infrastructure, Service\nsegment capabilities and rental pool assets. For fiscal year 2022, we anticipate our CapEx to be in the\nrange of $7.5 million to $8.5 million, with investments focused on technology infrastructure, rental pool\nassets and operational capability and efficiency projects, including calibration automation.\nSlide 10 highlights our strong balance sheet. At quarter end, we had total net debt of $19 million, which\nwas down $10.8 million from fiscal 2020 year-end. With this reduction, our leverage ratio also came\ndown and was slightly below 1 at quarter end. This is calculated as the total debt at the end of the period\ndivided by the trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA, including giving credit for any acquired EBITDA.\nAnd finally, we had $31.1 million available under our revolving credit facility at the end of the quarter.\nOne more thing, we expect to file our Form 10-K on or around June 7.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to you, Lee.\nLee Rudow: Thank you, Mark. We entered fiscal 2022 with a strong balance sheet, strong organic sales\npipeline and a very active acquisition pipeline. Operationally, we expect our fiscal 2021 gains in service\ngross margin to be largely sustainable. From a directional perspective, we like what we see when we\nlook ahead.\nOur confidence is high that we have both the right strategic plan in place and the ability to execute it. We\nexpect both operating segments to have a strong start to the new year.\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect service organic growth to be similar to what we just\nachieved in the trailing 2021 fourth quarter. We believe we can continue to improve service margins,\nalbeit at a more moderated level as the fiscal year progresses and technician productivity comparisons\nbecome more challenging. \nTranscat, Inc.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Financial Results\nMay 19, 2021\nPage 4 of 9\nMoving forward, automation will be a key focus. And we expect to gain more traction over the next 12 to\n24 months.\nDistribution has progressively improved since the pandemic started over the last year, and we believe\nthe trend will continue. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect distribution growth to be in the high\nteens on improving trends and an easy comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2021, which was heavily\nimpacted by the onset of COVID-19.\nAll in all, Transcat enters fiscal '22 well positioned. We remain focused on continuous improvement and\nleveraging technology as a competitive advantage to drive sustainable differentiation. In combination with\nimproved macroeconomic indicators, vaccine rollouts and accelerated expansion, we expect to enhance\nshareholder value in 2022 and beyond.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Palm with Craig-Hallum.\nGreg Palm: Congrats on the quarter here, really good results. I guess, just to start off on services. I'm\ncurious, what are you seeing in terms of growth by end market, 10% organic was a pretty solid number.\nAnd what I'm trying to figure out is that is it broad-based? Is it driven more by certain end markets like life\nsciences, what are you seeing?\nLee Rudow: Really, I would characterize it, Greg, as broad-based. We are seeing some recovery in the\nindustrial markets, which is always good for us. Life science has been consistent for years now. And so\nthat's certainly playing a role.\nBut overall, I would say that the double-digit growth is based upon a recovery across the industrial\nmarketplace, more than anything else from previous quarters.\nGreg Palm: Is that fair to say then that most of your end markets now are at/or exceeding kind of that\npre-pandemic level? Or do you still feel like there's some pent-up demand out there?\nLee Rudow: It's hard to tell with certainty, but I think most have recovered somewhat. I think there\nprobably is some pent-up demand. We'll see some of that throughout the year. I don't think oil and gas,\nfor example, has fully recovered. I think it's taken steps in that direction. So a little bit of pent-up demand,\nsome recovery, it's kind of a mix.\nGreg Palm: Okay. Got it. Makes sense. And then specifically on the margin, I just wanted to kind of\nclarify some comments. I thought Mark had said something about gross margins and service being\nsustainable, but the guidance kind of is vague in terms of expecting year-over-year improvement, but not\nto the same degree experienced last year. So can you just help us understand exactly what you mean by\nthe comments there?\nLee Rudow: Yes. I think Mark and I both try to allude to the fact that we expect the company to continue\nto drive improvements in our margin. Now we're coming off of a year with a 500 basis point improvement.\nAnd so we're cautious in that we don't want to send indicators that we expect to do that again. However,\nwe do expect to improve.\nAnd as I've said in the past, Mark has said in the past, it's not going to always be quarter-to-quarter. But\ndirectionally, we have things in place. We are investing in technology, we are investing in automation,\nwith the end purpose of driving margins, and we're going to get that done. That's our intention.\nSo you're seeing some tempering based upon year-over-year improvement. We don't see that\nnecessarily continuing at that rate, but we do see improvements. And that's what we're trying to convey.\nGreg Palm: But I guess, is the improvement commentary based on what you saw in last year's quarter?\nOr is it based on what you saw for the fiscal year? I'm just trying to gauge what kind of benchmark are\nwe using? Are we using 30% as the improvement level or the 26% in change that you saw last quarter a\nyear ago? \nTranscat, Inc.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Financial Results\nMay 19, 2021\nPage 5 of 9\nLee Rudow: Yes. I think you've got to get closer to the 30%. And like I said before, it could dip down 100\nbasis points here and there. We're in the 30% range, and I expect to stay there. And again, we alluded to\nthe sustainability of the improvements we made. I think you're going to see that apparent in this\nupcoming year.\nSo I think I'd guide you closer to the 30% then going back this time last year to 26%.\nMark Doheny: Yes. Just to be clear, that's for the full year. We have a full year of 30%. We just achieved\nthat milestone. We expect improvement for the full year. And Greg, to your point around the Q1\nguidance, we do expect improvement there, too. And if we were just sort of setting the tone that 500\nbasis points was an extremely good year. We expect improvement in both the quarter and the full year,\nbut maybe not to that degree.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Buck with H.C. Wainwright.\nScott Buck: It seems like a little bit of a slower start to M&A this calendar year. I'm curious, is that a\nreflection of the pricing environment? Or you get a little bit of a deer in the headlights from COVID with\nsome of the potential targets?\nLee Rudow: Yes. I wouldn't read into anything about the relative to a slow start to the calendar year. It\nwas about 2 quarters ago, almost 3 now, that we hired a VP of Corporate Development for the express\npurpose of really taking advantage of what we thought was going to be a good opportune time in the\nmarket to make acquisitions. And in combination with the fact, Scott, that we were ready as a company\nto sort of get to the next level.\nAnd nothing has changed. So we've built a really nice pipeline. And I try to characterize that in our script,\nand I think you'll see a higher level of activity as the year progresses. So taking the 3 or 4 months at the\nbeginning of calendar year, and I wouldn't characterize it as anything other than what it is, and it's a time\nwhen we have an active and well-built pipeline, and I expect to see some results from that.\nScott Buck: Okay. Good. I appreciate that color. Second one for me. How should we think about\nmargins in distribution longer term? I mean, can they be maintained at these levels? Or are we likely to\nsee some compression over time?\nLee Rudow: I think our goal is to see stability in distribution, and that would be both from a revenue and\na margin perspective. We have our rental program, which we launched about 4 or 5 years ago now for\nthe purpose of keeping margins stable. It's not as strategic as it was for the company 10 years ago,\ndistribution, but it does still provide us with a lot of leads and ample opportunity to sell service to\ncustomers who buy products from us. So we really want to see that business be stable over the next\ncouple of years. And we've designed it and we've invested so that it should get close to that stability. So\nthat's what we would expect. I don't expect margins to increase significantly. As it is satisfying.\nScott Buck: All right. Great. And then are you guys having any challenges in sourcing inventory in\ndistribution to meet some of this pickup in demand?\nLee Rudow: Yes. We actually are. Mark, do you want to address that?\nMark Doheny: Yes. What you're hearing and reading with all the other companies were sort of\nexperiencing the same thing, nothing unique to us, I would say. But between container shortages and\nCOVID ramping up production in certain areas being difficult and drivers.\nYes, our backlog in the distribution business is higher than it normally is. We've had some good orders\nrecently, but also, the lead times, it just takes longer from the time we tell our vendors, we need\nsomething to the time we get it. And we hope that works itself out, but we're not immune to what's going\non in the world there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gerry Sweeney with ROTH Capital. \nTranscat, Inc.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Financial Results\nMay 19, 2021\nPage 6 of 9\nGerry Sweeney: I want to start with revenue. Just this is more out of curiosity, I guess, than anything.\nBut how much of this jump is maybe we talked about a little bit of pent-up demand in the past versus\nmaybe just general economic expansion?\nLee Rudow: Gerry, I said a little bit earlier, I really think it's a combination of both. We are seeing\nrecovery in the industrial markets that has been helpful in terms of achieving growth. So that we would\nexpect to continue.\nAnd without question, there's an element of pent-up demand as well. So I think you're seeing a blend.\nWe're going to continue to guide service business towards that mid- to high single-digit growth\norganically. And I think we're confident in that range.\nGerry Sweeney: Got it. That's fair. And then just on the margin side, not to beat a dead horse, but any\nway you could maybe bucket out your maybe mix price versus productivity and enhancements. I know in\nthe past, we talked about software calibration being a longer-term driver of margin improvement. And just\nwant to see where that's laid out.\nMark Doheny: Gerry, this is Mark. For the quarter, it really was driven by technician productivity yearover-year. Achieving more standard hours with less hours. And when you start growing 10% organically,\nas Lee has talked about before and the team has talked about before, you have a lot of inherent\nleverage on our fixed cost.\nThose 2 things drove the vast majority of the past quarter and really for the full year, improvements. So\nthat's what I would continue to highlight.\nGerry Sweeney: Got it. And I don't want to put numbers in anyone's mouth, but for some reason, the\n35% gross margins long term was a number that just kind of stuck in my head. I'm not sure if that's the\nexact number. And obviously, I think software calibration and automation plays a big role into that. Is that\nwhat we're going to look towards maybe medium to long term?\nLee Rudow: When we think about margin enhancement and margin growth, we started this, call it a\njourney, for lack of a better word, back when we hit around 24-some-odd percent. And we had a pretty\ngood plan in place, Gerry, to get us to 30%. We got there probably earlier than we expected. And so\nthat's good news. But we're not done. And so the question is, what's achievable? And how long is it\ngoing to take?\nI think we're going to stick to the idea that we're going to have improvement over time. It's going to be\nfairly consistent. And I don't think it's unrealistic or unachievable to get into the mid-30s. I think that's a\nconversation that we're having internally. It's not going to be quarter-to-quarter. We don't have time\nframes on it, whether it be year or 2 or 3, but at some point in the future, I anticipate that we'll be having\nthat conversation.\nAnd so you probably heard mid-30s as something that was mentioned in the last meeting, during one of\nthe Q&A sessions. And it's part of the conversation.\nGerry Sweeney: Got it. That's fair. Again, I don't want to put any numbers in anyone's mouth, but that’s\nthe number was on top of my head.\nAnd then just on the labor side, any issues in actually acquiring labor? Everything seems to be tightening\nup across the board. And listen, great quarter. I think a lot of blue sky ahead of you. What I'm trying to\nfigure out is maybe even set the table a little bit that, as you said, don't look at things quarter-to-quarter,\nlook at it more year-to-year. And in the past, you've sometimes higher chunks, we'll say, of technicians\nand it's hit margins.\nJust curious if that could be in the play at some point, so no one gets surprised, et cetera?\nLee Rudow: Yes. So it's a great question. And anyone who has studied this company knows that when\nwe have to hire a lot of people at one time, there can be short-term deflation in margins, that could be a\nquarter or 2. It takes a couple of quarters to get a tech up and running. The more growth you achieve \nTranscat, Inc.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Financial Results\nMay 19, 2021\nPage 7 of 9\norganically, the more you're going to need technicians. Technicians are never easy to find. So there's\nalways going to be those training periods as you hire a large number of technicians.\nBut that shouldn't take our eye off the ball, which is longer term, efficiency in the operation and\nautomation and margin enhancement. So that's why we always say, let's not look at this quarter-toquarter. High rates of growth do sometimes have a short-term dampening effect on margins.\nNow as we get better at what we do and put more technology to our operation, we should be able to\noffset that better than we've been able to do in the past. So that will be a factor as well that we would\nlook to achieve.\nGerry Sweeney: Got it. And again, great quarter, and I actually look at the hiring as a positive.\nLee Rudow: Yes, exactly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mitra Ramgopal with Sidoti & Company.\nMitra Ramgopal: First, just on the higher CapEx and investments in technology infrastructure, if you can\ngive us a sense in terms of where that might entail and in terms of helping you facilitate expansion via\nM&A and also overall improving margins further.\nMark Doheny: Yes. I would say we are forecasting that we'll spend a little more this year in the $7.5\nmillion to $8.5 million range. We're going to continue investing in technology, we've talked about that.\nWe'll continue to invest in rental pool assets, maybe even slightly more than the prior year as it grows\nvery quickly. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that automation, calibration automation, there will be\ninvestments in that area. And that's going to have a year-over-year impact more than we invested in the\nprior year.\nSo nothing really out of the ordinary. The good news, it's really centered around initiatives that are going\nto help us long term. That's how I would answer that question.\nMitra Ramgopal: Okay. Noted. And then, Lee, just a real big picture question. If you can give us a sense\nas how much you think maybe the competitive environment has changed as a result of the pandemic and\nmaybe opportunities that you have now from an M&A standpoint or even just maybe if you're seeing any\nwillingness of some potential costs as it relates to sourcing that might have been existing before.\nLee Rudow: Well, from an M&A perspective, Mitra, we did anticipate some quarters ago sometime last\nyear, longer term that the pandemic was going to have the type of effect on the market and on smaller\ncompetitors that might perhaps make available some acquisitions that wouldn't otherwise be available to\nus. And people would get tired, and it would be a difficult challenge for smaller companies.\nAnd I think all that's come to fruition. We an active pipeline that we are pursuing and working. And I think\nthat an uptick in M&A activity will be a byproduct of some of those factors, the COVID effect.\nBut it's also a factor that we're facing on that, we've hired, as I mentioned before, a VP to drive those\ninitiatives for us. So it's a combination of right time, right efforts, right investment, and I think you'll see an\nuptick in some activity levels.\nMitra Ramgopal: And then just on the perhaps increased willingness of maybe from customers now or\nto clients as it relates to outsourcing the services to you?\nLee Rudow: Right. We haven't seen a major shift or change so far in this fiscal year or even in Q4 in\nterms of outsourcing. We'll always be well positioned to do what we call our client-based labs when\nthere's a market for it. But we do expect to achieve our organic growth rates, whether it's from clientbased labs, which is a byproduct of outsourcing or any of our other activities to achieve organic growth.\nSo one way or the other, but I can't note a specific change in the last 60 days. That may occur later in the\nyear, and I would certainly talk about it when that happens.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dick Ryan with Colliers Securities. \nTranscat, Inc.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Financial Results\nMay 19, 2021\nPage 8 of 9\nDick Ryan: Say Lee, as a follow-up to the CBL, how many of those are you operating now? And what\nkind of margin contribution do they bring in? Is it additive or dilutive to the core margins you see?\nLee Rudow: Dick, we've got about 20 of those going nationwide, which is the same number we had last\nyear. We've not lost any of them in the 9.5 years I've been here, and we've gained some through the\nyears, obviously. From a dilutive standpoint, the margins tend to be in range of our normal margins.\nI think it could be 100 basis points less, depending on the particular customer. But as you know, these\nare very sticky, and there's a high lifetime value of these customers. So sometimes, that's the benefit that\nyou get. But yes, I would say that the numbers in the 20 range.\nDick Ryan: Okay. So on the CapEx for the rental pool assets, it's growing rapidly, small base. Any kind\nof ballpark of how you position that business and what rental could contribute 3, 5 years down the road?\nHow big of a market is that you're trying to achieve?\nLee Rudow: Right. Our story, Dick is going to be about the same as it's been in the past. And we\nlaunched that business back in '16 with the idea of stabilizing distribution, bridging together our\nDistribution segment with our Service segment, there was a sort of a myriad of benefits that we're looking\nto achieve. And nothing has really changed.\nIt's not part of our current strategic plan to be a $50 million revenue rental company. It is realistic,\nhowever, to say that we could go from where we are today, which is $5 million, $6 million rental\ncompany, let's say, to a $10 million revenue company, that very much is part of our plan.\nSo I think modest growth, so that continues to stabilize that business, help stabilize that business for the\nexpress purpose of helping to generate leads and cash flow so that we can grow our Service business.\nThat's our strategy. That's rentals part in that strategy, and I think it's going to continue.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Kara Anderson with B. Riley\nSecurities.\nKara Anderson: Just one more on M&A from me. Just curious if there's an appetite or an availability of\nlarger acquisition opportunities out there?\nLee D. Rudow: Kara, I appreciate the question. Our pipeline today is rather different than it was a year\nago at this time for 2 reasons. One, there are more opportunities that we're looking at today from a\nvolume perspective. And again, that's based upon the initiatives we've launched to make it so.\nBut within the pipeline itself, we are looking at larger opportunities. And when we say larger, we're talking\nour average size in the past has been the $3 million to $5 million revenue range. We've done something\na little larger.\nBut I would characterize our current pipeline as having similar type deals in it and some larger type deals\nthat are closer to sort of the $8 million to $10 million range, $10 million to $12 million range. It sort of runs\nthe gamut, but I do think there's some interesting opportunities, and we just have to eventually see if it's\na good match and if we can get some deals done.\nKara Anderson: Got it. And then just one last one on the guide for distribution growth in the high-teens\nrange, which imply a sequential decrease from the fourth quarter. Can you help me with that? Why would\nthat be the case as you look more towards a recovery and sort of seasonality offsetting it?\nMark Doheny: Yes. It's just the normal seasonality of the business. Kara, I would describe that as just\nposted factors, but that's the normal seasonality of the business.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for\nclosing remarks.\nLee Rudow: Well, this is Lee. I appreciate everyone being on the call today. Thank you for joining us.\nFeel free to check with us anytime. Otherwise, I guess we'll speak with everyone after we release our\nfirst quarter results. Thanks again for participating. \nTranscat, Inc.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Financial Results\nMay 19, 2021\nPage 9 of 9\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

Total fiscal third quarter revenue growth of 2.5% year-over-year, combined with the ongoing success of our team in strategically shifting and accelerating key priorities across our business resulted in a 2.8% year-over-year increase in gross profit with a strong gross margin of 70.6%.\n\n“Accelerating demand for our neXus Ultrasonic Surgical System and record BoneScalpel and SonaStar product sales growth drove a 13.7% year-over-year increase in fiscal third quarter total surgical revenue, including 14.7% growth domestically and 11.8% growth internationally. Recall, we recorded 41% year-over-year domestic surgical revenue growth in the comparable fiscal third quarter of 2020 following the launch of neXus in the United States. As such, we are pleased with our ability to achieve mid-teens domestic surgical revenue growth in the current quarter despite the difficult comparison. Though our wound business remains challenged, our SonicOne product sales increased 26% quarter over quarter and we believe that our regenerative products are on an improved trajectory as treatment begins to return to wound care centers.\n\n“During the fiscal third quarter, we launched neXus in select international markets including Canada and parts of the European Union, as well as a number of other select countries. The tremendous response we have received from global healthcare practitioners to-date is further affirmation of the efficiency and efficacy our ultrasonic technology delivers in treating procedures across spine surgery, neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, laparoscopic surgery, and wound care. We also announced a new range of extremity fixation products to address the orthoplastics market, which complement our existing wound debridement and regenerative products portfolio. By creating a more encompassing offering, we not only significantly increase our average revenue per procedure, but also believe that we have further enhanced physicians’ ability to improve patient outcomes.\n\n“In summary, we are encouraged by the early signs of a recovery that we are seeing across our business in both surgical and wound. The overall operating environment has continued to improve, though there are some clear differences by geography and procedural focus. Looking ahead, we expect to see an acceleration in our surgical business and a return to growth in our wound segment beginning in the second half of calendar 2021. We remain focused on developing and refining our commercial infrastructure, including acquiring additional sales resources, to ensure that we are in the best position to drive market share gains and further adoption of our surgical and regenerative products as we move deeper into the recovery phase. We are confident this approach will enable Misonix to deliver on goals for long-term profitable growth and enhanced shareholder value.”\n\nSales Performance Supplemental Data\n\n \t \tFor the three months ended\t \t \n \t \tMarch 31,\tNet change\n \t \t2021\t \t2020\t \t$\t \t%\nTotal\t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \nSurgical\t \t$\t10,351,130\t \t \t$\t9,102,711\t \t \t$\t1,248,419\t \t \t13.7\t%\nWound\t \t \t7,996,050\t \t \t \t8,799,801\t \t \t \t(803,751\t)\t \t-9.1\t%\nTotal\t \t$\t18,347,180\t \t \t$\t17,902,512\t \t \t$\t444,668\t \t \t2.5\t%\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \nDomestic:\t \t \t \t \t \t \t \nSurgical\t \t$\t6,940,825\t \t \t$\t6,052,548\t \t \t$\t888,277\t \t \t14.7\t%\nWound\t \t \t7,872,060\t \t \t \t8,725,868\t \t \t \t(853,808\t)\t \t-9.8\t%\nTotal\t \t$\t14,812,885\t \t \t$\t14,778,416\t \t \t$\t34,469\t \t \t0.2\t%\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \nInternational:\t \t \t \t \t \t \t \nSurgical\t \t$\t3,410,305\t \t \t$\t3,050,163\t \t \t$\t360,142\t \t \t11.8\t%\nWound\t \t \t123,990\t \t \t \t73,933\t \t \t \t50,057\t \t \t67.7\t%\nTotal\t \t$\t3,534,295\t \t \t$\t3,124,096\t \t \t$\t410,199\t \t \t13.1\t%\n \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \nJoe Dwyer, Chief Financial Officer, added, “We are encouraged by our ability to generate product revenue growth both on a year-over-year and quarterly sequential basis against the backdrop of a difficult, albeit improving, operating environment. Notably, the various initiatives we have implemented over the last year to streamline our cost structure enabled us to meaningfully reduce third quarter operating expenses by 11.6%, or $2.1 million, compared to the prior year period. Top line growth, combined with healthy gross margins of over 70% and lower operating expenses, resulted in a 73.3% year-over-year improvement in Adjusted EBITDA to a loss of $1.0 million in the fiscal 2021 third quarter, compared to a loss of $3.8 million in the prior year.\n\n“We continued to deliver on our goal of lowering our cash burn and recently restructured our term debt to lower our borrowing rate and extend the maturity date and debt repayment schedule. With a strong balance sheet reflecting approximately $31 million in cash at March 31, 2021, we are confident that our liquidity position will support the continued investment in our business and our goals for growth. We continue to see an improvement in general market conditions and procedural volumes across most of our markets as the vaccine rollout progresses. Assuming this trend continues without any further disruptions, we expect to generate fiscal 2021 full year revenue of $72.8 million to $73.3 million.”\n\nFiscal Third Quarter 2021 Conference Call and Webcast\nMisonix will host a conference call and webcast today, May 6, 2021, at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss its financial results and operations, and host a question and answer session.

The Company defines EBITDA as the net income (loss) as reported under GAAP, plus depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and income tax expense (benefit). The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus non-cash stock compensation expense and M&A transaction fees. Historically, the Company excluded bad debt expense from its calculation of Adjusted EBITDA by adding bad debt expense to EBITDA. Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the Company will no longer exclude bad debt expense from the calculation Adjusted EBITDA, and prior comparative periods will be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe Company has also provided below pro-forma revenue, which is also a non-GAAP financial measurement. The Company acquired the operations of Solsys Medical at the end of its first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2019. The Company has presented pro forma revenue to show revenue on a comparable basis as if Solsys had been acquired at the beginning of the comparative periods presented.\n\nWe present these non-GAAP measures because we believe these measures are useful indicators of our operating performance. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures principally as a measure of our operating performance and believes that these measures are useful to investors because they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate the operating performance of companies in our industry.

Approximately 99% of our communities are currently accepting new residents, resulting\nin an acceleration in move-in activity and occupancy rates in recent weeks. Through April 23, 2021, total SHO portfolio occupancy\nincreased by approximately 60 bps to 73.8% from the pandemic-low on March 12, 2021. Occupancy rates are as follows:\nFebruary 2020 December 2020 January 2021 February 2021 March 2021\nSpot occupancy (1) 85.4 % 75.9 % 74.4 % 73.6 % 73.6 %\nSequential occupancy change (1.5) % (0.8) % — %\n(1) Spot occupancy represents approximate month end occupancy at our share for properties in operation as of February 29, 2020, including unconsolidated properties\nbut excluding acquisitions, executed dispositions and development conversions since this date.\nOn a month-to-date basis, as of April 23, 2021, SHO portfolio occupancy has increased approximately 20 bps. Occupancy continued\nto strengthen in the U.S. and U.K. with gains of approximately 40 bps and 90 bps, respectively. However, occupancy declined\napproximately 20 bps in Canada over the same period following a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases and implementation of shelter in\nplace orders across parts of the country.\nAs of April 23, 2021, approximately 97% of our SHO communities reported no confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the trailing two\nweeks, 3% have reported 1-2 cases and 0% have reported 3+ cases. Virtually all assisted living and memory care communities have\ncompleted their final scheduled vaccination clinics.\nIn 2020, applications were made for amounts under Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the Provider Relief Fund related to our SHO portfolio.\nDuring the first quarter, we received net pro rata Provider Relief Funds of approximately $35 million, which was recognized as a\nreduction to COVID-19 costs within property operating expenses.\nOur share of property-level expenses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic relating to our total SHO portfolio, net of\nreimbursements including Provider Relief Funds and similar programs in the U.K. and Canada, totaled a benefit of approximately $23\nmillion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to an expense of approximately $7 million for the three months ended\nPage 1 of 9\nMarch 31, 2020. These costs included higher labor expenses coupled with expenditures related to procurement of personal protective\nequipment and other supplies, net of any reimbursements. Such amounts had a favorable impact on net income attributable to common\nstockholders and normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.05 for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and an unfavorable impact of\n$0.02 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2020.\nRent Collections During the first quarter, we collected approximately 96% of rent due from operators under Triple-net lease\nagreements (primarily seniors housing and post-acute care facilities). Of the uncollected amounts of Triple-net rent, the majority\nrelates to leases on a cash basis of revenue recognition. In the Outpatient Medical segment, we collected 99% of rent due in the first\nquarter, with uncollected amounts primarily attributable to local jurisdictions with COVID-19 related ordinances providing temporary\nrent relief to tenants. Virtually all rent subject to approved deferral agreements has been repaid in full.\nCapital Activity and Liquidity Inclusive of available borrowings under our line of credit, cash and cash equivalents, and IRC Section\n1031 deposits, at April 27, 2021, we have $4.0 billion of near-term available liquidity and no material senior unsecured note maturities\nuntil 2024. Through the first and second quarter, we sold 3.7 million shares of common stock under our ATM program via forward\nsale agreements at an initial weighted average price of $73.43 per share, generating future expected gross proceeds of approximately\n$272 million.\nOn March 25, 2021 we completed the issuance of $750 million senior unsecured notes bearing interest at 2.80% with a maturity date\nof June 2031. Net proceeds were used to fund the April 15, 2021 redemption of all $339 million aggregate amount outstanding of the\n3.75% senior notes due March 2023 and all $335 million aggregate amount outstanding of the 3.95% senior notes due September\n2023. The remaining proceeds were used to reduce borrowings under our term loan due April 2022. During the quarter we\nextinguished $42 million of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 7.60%.\nDividend On April 28, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 of $0.61 per share.\nThis dividend, which will be paid on May 20, 2021 to stockholders of record on May 11, 2021, will be our 200th consecutive quarterly\ncash dividend. The declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends remains subject to review and approval by the Board of\nDirectors.\nQuarterly Investment and Disposition Activity In the first quarter, we completed $368 million of pro rata gross investments\nincluding $209 million in acquisitions at a blended initial yield of 6.2%. Additionally, $121 million in development funding with an\nexpected stable yield of 7.1% and $38 million of loan funding at a yield of 7.3% were completed. We converted four development\nprojects for an aggregate pro rata amount of $174 million and an expected stable yield of 6.2%. Additionally, during the quarter we\ncompleted pro rata property dispositions of $216 million at a 5.5% yield.\nNotable Investments and Dispositions\nHarbor Retirement Associates During the first quarter, we acquired a portfolio of eight seniors housing properties located throughout\nthe southeast for a pro rata investment of $132 million. The communities will be operated by Harbor Retirement Associates under a\nnew triple-net master lease.\nPappas Properties and Atrium Health During the first quarter, we delivered two state-of-the-art \"Class A+\" medical office buildings\npreviously under development in Charlotte, North Carolina as part of the joint venture between Pappas Properties and Welltower. Both\nbuildings are 100% master leased to Atrium Health (Moody's: Aa3) for 15 years. The project is part of a multi-phase, health care\nanchored, mixed-use development located next to Atrium Health's flagship Carolinas Medical Center campus. The properties will\nhouse integrated specialty clinical practices for Atrium Health including the Sanger Heart and Vascular Institute.\nWafra Joint Venture During the first quarter, we completed the previously announced joint venture partnership with certain investment\nvehicles managed by Wafra by contributing five properties, to the joint venture for a pro rata sales price of $110 million. In total, the\njoint venture comprises a portfolio of 23 outpatient medical properties previously majority-owned by Welltower located in Texas,\nFlorida, Minnesota, the Carolinas, Tennessee, California, Pennsylvania and Washington, among other states. Through the partnership,\nwe retained a 20% economic interest in the portfolio, along with leasing and property management responsibilities.\nInvesco Real Estate Outpatient Medical Joint Ventures We announced our initial joint venture agreement with Invesco Real Estate\n(\"IRE\"), a global real estate investment manager, in November 2019 in conjunction with the plan to sell an 85% interest in 31\nproperties, representing approximately 2.2 million square feet, for a total pro rata sales price of $612 million at a yield of 5.6%. We\nretained leasing, property management and asset management responsibilities for the joint venture.\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, we expanded our partnership with IRE through a new joint venture which comprises a portfolio of 20\noutpatient medical properties previously majority owned by Welltower, spanning 1.0 million square feet across five states for a total\ntransaction price of $402 million. The average age of the properties is 16 years, with roughly half of the portfolio affiliated with health\nsystems. Through the partnership, we retained a 15% economic interest in the portfolio, along with leasing, property management and\nasset management responsibilities. During 2020, we sold 18 of the 20 IRE properties for a total pro rata sales price of $302 million at a\n5.4% yield. In the first quarter of 2021, we closed the remaining two properties for $37 million. In addition, during the quarter a right\nof first refusal was exercised for one property at a sales price of $12 million.\n1Q21 Earnings Release April 28, 2021\nPage 2 of 9\nOther Notable Transactions During the first quarter, we acquired two seniors housing properties for $50 million. StoryPoint Senior\nLiving and Chelsea Senior Living will each operate a property under a triple-net lease. Also during the first quarter, we closed on the\nacquisition of a $5 million seniors housing property operated by Frontier Management as part of the existing joint-venture agreement.\nAdditionally, we completed the acquisition of a $14 million medical office building and the purchase of an assisted living community\nfor $8 million that are owned in the existing joint venture with ProMedica and included in the existing triple-net master lease. Lastly,\nduring the first quarter, we made two loan advances secured by senior mortgages on two seniors housing properties for a total of $38\nmillion.\nNotable Post Quarter Transactions\nGenesis Healthcare As previously announced, we entered into definitive agreements to execute a series of mutually beneficial\ntransactions intended to substantially exit Welltower's operating relationship with Genesis Healthcare. In April, we contributed nine\nmostly purpose built PowerBack facilities, which provide higher acuity, short-stay rehabilitation and care, into an 80/20 joint venture\nwith ProMedica at a total value of $292 million. The nine properties were added to the existing master lease with ProMedica.\nAdditionally, we have entered into definitive agreements to sell 35 properties which are primarily traditional skilled nursing facilities\nfor $496 million to a joint venture with Aurora Health Network and Peace Capital, in which Welltower will retain a noncontrolling\ninterest with a right to preferential distributions. These property dispositions, along with the transfer of operations of the facilities to\nleading regional operators, is expected to occur primarily in the second and third quarters. Additionally, we currently lease seven\nskilled nursing facilities, which we sublease to Genesis. We have entered into an agreement to transition the operations of these\nproperties into a new lease agreement with a regional operator. We have a bargain purchase option on these properties, which we\nexpect to execute in April 2023. We have entered into a forward sales agreement for the seven properties valued at $182 million with\nthe Aurora Health Network joint venture that is intended to close simultaneously with the purchase option exercise.\nTo effectuate the transition of all 51 assets, we agreed to provide Genesis a lease termination fee of $86 million upon the successful\ntransition of all properties, which will be used to immediately repay indebtedness to Welltower. Additionally, upon achievement of\ncertain restructuring milestones, we will reduce Genesis' indebtedness by an additional $170 million in exchange for an equity interest\nin Genesis, allowing for participation in the expected post-COVID recovery in fundamentals. Upon conclusion of the aforementioned\nloan transactions, Genesis will have $167 million of indebtedness to Welltower, exclusive of additional PIK interest, which will carry\na maturity date of January 1, 2024. As of March 31, 2021, our total carrying value of Genesis loans receivable was $139 million.\nProMedica Joint Venture Disposition As previously announced, the Welltower and ProMedica joint venture intends to divest a 25\nproperty portfolio of non-strategic skilled nursing facilities for $265 million. The properties, which were acquired through the\nformation of the Welltower/ProMedica joint venture in 2018, are in eight states and have an average age of 41 years. The disposition is\nexpected to be completed in tranches during the second and third quarters and is expected to generate an unlevered IRR of 22% over\nthe 2.5 year ownership period of the assets.\nSafanad/HC-One Loan Funding and Equity Investment On April 28, 2021, we announced that we provided £540 million ($750\nmillion) of senior loan financing and a £30 million ($42 million) delayed facility to affiliates of Safanad, a global real estate and\nprivate equity firm, as part of the successful recapitalization of its investment in HC-One Group. The recapitalization will enhance\nHC-One’s ability to meet the complex care needs of the communities it serves and reinforces its commitment to its team members at\nall levels of the organization, while enabling HC-One to continue to modernize and enhance its portfolio of care homes. The loan has a\n5-year term and is fully collateralized by the shares and assets of the HC-One Group, including its underlying property portfolio of\nowned assets across the United Kingdom. Welltower’s last pound basis on the initial £540 million tranche is approximately £40,000\nper unit.\nAdditionally, we will have the ability to participate in the anticipated recovery in the U.K. seniors housing sector through both\nwarrants and a £55 million equity investment. The investments, inclusive of the loan, are expected to be accretive to our earnings.\nOther Notable Transactions Subsequent to quarter-end, we acquired two seniors housing properties located in Philadelphia and\nQuebec for a pro rata investment of $68 million. The properties are operated by Sunrise Senior Living and Chartwell Retirement\nResidences. In addition, we made a loan advancement for $18 million that is secured by a senior mortgage on a seniors housing\nproperty operated by Frontier Management.\nOutlook for Second Quarter 2021 The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our operations and those of our operators\nand tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the\nscope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact and the direct and\nindirect economic effects of the pandemic and related containment and vaccination measures, among others. Accordingly, we are only\nintroducing earnings guidance for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 and expect to report net income attributable to common\nstockholders in a range of $0.31 to $0.36 per diluted share and normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders in a range of\n$0.72 to $0.77 per diluted share. In preparing our guidance, we have made the following assumptions:\n• Provider Relief Funds: Our second quarter guidance does not include the recognition of any Provider Relief Funds which\nmay be received during the quarter.\n1Q21 Earnings Release April 28, 2021\nPage 3 of 9\n• SHO Portfolio Occupancy: Midpoint of FFO guidance assumes a continuation of recent trends resulting in an approximate\nincrease of 130 bps through the second quarter.\n• General and Administrative Expenses: We anticipate full year general and administrative expenses to be approximately $135\nmillion to $140 million and stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $21 million.\n• Investments: Our second quarter 2021 earnings guidance includes only those acquisitions closed or announced to date.\nFurthermore, no transitions or restructures beyond those announced to date are included.\n• Development: We anticipate funding approximately $320 million of development in 2021 relating to projects underway on\nMarch 31, 2021.\n• Dispositions: We expect pro rata disposition proceeds of $1.1 billion at a blended yield of 7.9% in 2021. This includes\napproximately $433 million in proceeds from dispositions and loan payoffs completed to date and $681 million of\nincremental expected proceeds related to properties classified as held-for-sale as of March 31, 2021.\nOur guidance does not include any additional investments, dispositions or capital transactions beyond those we have announced, nor\nany other expenses, impairments, unanticipated additions to the loan loss reserve or other additional normalizing items. Please see the\nSupplemental Reporting Measures section for further discussion and our definition of normalized FFO and Exhibit 3 for a\nreconciliation of the outlook for net income available to common stockholders to normalized FFO attributable to common\nstockholders. We will provide additional detail regarding our second quarter outlook and assumptions on the first quarter 2021\nconference call.\nConference Call Information We have scheduled a conference call on Thursday, April 29, 2021 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss\nour first quarter 2021 results, industry trends and portfolio performance. Telephone access will be available by dialing (844) 467-7115\nor (409) 983-9837 (international). For those unable to listen to the call live, a taped rebroadcast will be available beginning two hours\nafter completion of the call through May 13, 2021. To access the rebroadcast, dial (855) 859-2056 or (404) 537-3406\n(international). The conference ID number is 4881434. To participate in the webcast, log on to www.welltower.com 15 minutes before\nthe call to download the necessary software. Replays will be available for 90 days.\nSupplemental Reporting Measures We believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders (\"NICS\"), as\ndefined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"), are the most appropriate earnings measurements. However,\nwe consider funds from operations (\"FFO\") and normalized FFO to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance.\nThese supplemental measures are disclosed on our pro rata ownership basis. Pro rata amounts are derived by reducing consolidated\namounts for minority partners’ noncontrolling ownership interests and adding our minority ownership share of unconsolidated\namounts. We do not control unconsolidated investments. While we consider pro rata disclosures useful, they may not accurately depict\nthe legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution.\nHistorical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets\ndiminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically\nrisen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real\nestate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment\nTrusts (\"NAREIT\") created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost\ndepreciation from net income. FFO attributable to common stockholders, as defined by NAREIT, means net income attributable to\ncommon stockholders, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairments\nof depreciable assets, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and\nnoncontrolling interests. Normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders represents FFO attributable to common stockholders\nadjusted for certain items detailed in Exhibit 2. We believe that normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders is a useful\nsupplemental measure of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use this measure to compare the operating\nperformance of the Company between periods or as compared to other REITs or other companies on a consistent basis without having\nto account for differences caused by unanticipated and/or incalculable items.\nOur supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts\nand ratings agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Our management uses these\nfinancial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating\ndecisions. Additionally, they are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. The supplemental reporting measures do\nnot represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not\nbe considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental reporting measures, as defined by us, may\nnot be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies. Please see the exhibits\nfor reconciliations of supplemental reporting measures and the supplemental information package for the quarter ended March 31,\n2021, which is available on the Company’s website (www.welltower.com), for information and reconciliations of additional\nsupplemental reporting measures.\nAbout Welltower Welltower Inc.

Gallagher & Co.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis CFO Commentary contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include,\nfor our brokerage and risk management segments, 2021 estimates, as applicable, of the impact of foreign currency on EPS and revenues, integration costs, workforce and lease\ntermination costs, adjusted EBITDAC margin, amortization, depreciation, change in estimated earnout payables, acquisition rollover revenues, the adjusted effective tax rate,\nearnings from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests and the weighted average multiple paid for acquisitions. These forward-looking statements may also\ninclude, for our corporate segment, estimates of the net earnings attributable to controlling interests impact of various items, including interest and banking costs, Gallagher’s clean\nenergy investments, acquisition costs and corporate expenses. We also make forward-looking statements relating to our clean energy investments, including the low and high\nranges of potential 2021 annual after-tax earnings of the various clean energy plants, Chem-Mod royalty income, net of noncontrolling interests, and net after-tax cash flows from our\nclean energy investments, including the low and high ranges of potential results in 2021 and 2022.\nActual results may differ materially from the estimates set forth herein. The ongoing economic impact of COVID-19 is a major source of uncertainty impacting these estimates.\nReaders are therefore cautioned against relying on any of the forward-looking statements, which are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future\nperformance. Statements regarding our clean energy investments and future effective tax rates could be materially impacted by various other risks and uncertainties, including\nuncertainties related to political and regulatory developments, such as potential actions by Congress or challenges by the IRS eliminating or reducing the availability of tax credits\nunder IRC Section 45 retroactively and/or going forward which could be influenced by the priorities of the current president's administration and a Democratic-led Congress; the\npotential for divergent business objectives by co-investors and other stakeholders; plant operational risks, including supply-chain risks; sustainability concerns of shareholders or\nother stakeholder groups; utilities’ future use of, or demand for, coal; the market price of coal; the costs of moving a clean coal plant; intellectual property litigation risks; and\nenvironmental risks. The after-tax cash flows from our clean energy investments depend upon us generating sufficient taxable income in the U.S., which could be materially affected\nby the factors described below for our other forward-looking statements. The other forward-looking statements referred to above could be materially impacted by various risks and\nuncertainties including litigation and regulatory liability; changes in the economy (for example, due to COVID-19, climate risks, trade wars, political violence and unrest in the U.S. or\nother countries, or Brexit) or premium rates; changes in our acquisition pipeline and number of completed acquisitions; changes in our competitive position; changes in accounting\nstandards; and fluctuations in global exchange rates. All of these risks and uncertainties could be aggravated further by the COVID-19 crisis.\nIn addition, on page 8, we make forward-looking statements regarding our agreement to acquire certain Willis Towers Watson plc brokerage operations, which include, but are not\nlimited to, statements regarding expected benefits of the proposed transaction, the expected consideration to be paid in the proposed transaction, the expected revenue, EPS\n(including non-GAAP variations thereof), and EBITDAC impacts of the proposed transaction, the size and status of the combined organization within various jurisdictions, required\nregulatory approvals, the expected timing of the completion of the proposed transaction, expected duration and costs of integration, and the anticipated financing of the proposed\ntransaction. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements include (a) risks related to the integration of the acquired\noperations, businesses and assets into our company; (b) the possibility that the proposed transaction is not completed when expected or at all because required regulatory approvals\nare not received or other conditions to the closing are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all; (c) potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships,\nincluding those resulting from the announcement or completion of the proposed transaction; (d) the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction, including cost\nsavings and expected synergies, are not realized when expected or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or issues arising from, the integration of the acquired operations into\nour company; (e) the possibility that our estimates of lost revenue in the acquired operations from breakage due to departing key brokers and other employees and the loss of clients\nare incorrect and actual lost revenue is greater than expected; (f) the increased legal and regulatory complexity of entering additional geographic markets, including the risks\nassociated with the labor and employment law frameworks in certain countries where the Company does not currently operate; (g) conditions imposed in order to obtain required\nregulatory approvals; (h) the possibility that the proposed transaction may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events;\n(i) diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities; (j) the inability to retain certain key employees of the acquired operations or the\nCompany; (k) risks associated with increased leverage from the proposed transaction; (l) competitive responses to the proposed transaction; (m) uncertainties as to the timing of the\nconsummation of the proposed transaction and the ability of each party to consummate the proposed transaction; (n) that financial information subsequently presented for the\nacquired business in our subsequent public filings may be different from that presented herein; and (o) additional factors discussed in the section entitled “Information Concerning\nForward-Looking Statements” in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2021 and “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic currently amplifies, and in the future could continue to amplify, the risks, uncertainties and\nassumptions, reflected in such forward looking statements and risk factors.\nPlease refer to Gallagher’s filings with the SEC, including Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of its most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form\n10-Q, for a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could impact its forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement made by Gallagher in this press release\nspeaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by applicable law, Gallagher does not undertake to update the information included herein.\nPage 2\nInformation Regarding Non-GAAP Measures\nOctober 26, 2017\nNon-GAAP Measures\nArthur J. Gallagher & Co.\nIn this CFO Commentary, we have provided information regarding Adjusted EBITDAC Margin (for the brokerage and risk management segments) and Adjusted Net Earnings\nAttributable to Controlling Interests (for the corporate segment) presented on a forward-looking and historical basis. Adjusted EBITDAC Margin is Adjusted EBITDAC divided by\nAdjusted Revenue (EBITDAC, Revenue (for the brokerage segment), and Revenue before Reimbursements (for the risk management segment), respectively, adjusted to exclude the\nimpact of net gains realized on divestitures and costs relating to existing businesses, acquisition integration costs, workforce related charges, lease termination related charges,\nacquisition related adjustments (which in the first quarter of 2020, excluded certain COVID-19 adjustments related to changed estimates of future revenues), the period-over-period\nimpact of foreign currency translation, and, for the corporate segment, acquisition integration costs are related to certain of our larger acquisitions outside the scope of our usual tuck-in\nstrategy, and income tax related adjustments, as defined on page 5, note 5 and note 6 (relating to Brexit)). EBITDAC is net earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation,\namortization and the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables. Adjusted Net Earnings Attributable to Controlling Interests is net earnings attributable to controlling interests\nadjusted to exclude pre-acquisition costs and income tax related adjustments, as defined on page 5, notes 4 through 6. Management believes that both Adjusted EBITDAC Margin and\nAdjusted Net Earnings Attributable to Controlling Interests are meaningful indicators of our operating performance. The adjustments made to each measure are intended to improve the\ncomparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of items that have a high degree of variability.\nWe have not reconciled the forward-looking Adjusted EBITDAC Margin information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because certain material items that impact this\nmeasure, including the timing and exact amount of highly variable elements of revenue (such as acquired revenue), gains from the sales of books of business and divestitures and\nacquisition related adjustments, have not yet occurred or are out of management’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted\nEBITDAC Margin to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort. Please see our most recent earnings release and page 5 of this CFO Commentary\nfor reconciliations of historical non-GAAP information to the closest GAAP information.

GALLAGHER & CO. - CFO COMMENTARY - JUNE 17, 2021\nDuring the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 2019, Gallagher moved three 2011 Era plants into 2009 Era locations. These plants are operating under long‐term production contracts as of December 31, 2019. During the\nsecond quarter of 2020, Gallagher purchased a 2011 Era plant from a third party, which began operating under a long‐term production contract in July 2020. During the first quarter of 2021, Gallagher moved one 2011 Era plant\ninto a 2009 Era location and is currently operating under a long‐term production contract.\nThe 14 plants which were placed in service early in December 2009 (2009 Era Plants) received tax credits through early December 2019. The 21 plants which were placed in service in November and December 2011 (2011 Era\nPlants) can receive tax credits through November and December 2021.\nThe following provides certain information related to Gallagher’s investments in limited liability companies that own 35 clean coal production plants, which produce refined coal using proprietary technologies owned by Chem‐Mod.\nWe believe that the production and sale of refined coal at these plants qualifies to receive refined coal tax credits under IRC Section 45 through 2019 for the fourteen 2009 Era Plants and through 2021 for the twenty one 2011 Era\nPlants. The underlying operations of those investments where Gallagher has a controlling ownership interest are consolidated.\n2022 Estimates (5)\nSunset in 2019\nSunset in 2019\nReflects management's current estimate of the 2021 low and high ranges of as adjusted after‐tax earnings based on conversations with the host utilities, investment partner assumptions, current and future natural gas prices,\nand lower coal‐generated electricity consumption in the U.S. due to reduced economic activity resulting from the COVID‐19 crisis. Host utilities have not, and may not, consistently utilize the fuel plants at ultimate production\nlevels due to seasonal electricity demand, weather conditions, as well as many other operational, regulatory and environmental compliance reasons. Estimates could vary, potentially significantly, from current projections.\nGallagher’s investment in Chem‐Mod generates royalty income from refined coal plants owned by those limited liability companies in which it invests as well as refined coal production plants owned by other unrelated parties.\nEstimates are based on production estimates provided by licensees.\nThe law that provides for the generation of Section 45 tax credits will sunset in December 2021 for the 21 investments that own 2011 Era plants. Absent an extension, Gallagher would not generate any 2022 GAAP after‐tax net\nearnings from these clean energy investments. Instead, beginning in 2022, Gallagher should begin a period of increased tax credit carryforward utilization that should favorably impact net after‐tax cash flow.\n2021 Estimates (3)\nPage 6\nThis communication is subject to, and you are urged to carefully read, the cautions set forth at the beginning of this communication.\nAll estimates, unless specifically stated otherwise, do not contemplate the May 12, 2021 announced acquisition of certain Willis Towers Watson plc brokerage operations.\nClean Energy Investments - Continued\nAccounting for Clean Energy Investments\nCredits Credits Credits Credits Credits Credits\n(in millions) Produced Recognized Produced Recognized Produced Recognized\n1st Quarter $ 55.2 $ 101.1 $ 31.2 $ 70.4 $ 52.6 $ 55.2\n2nd Quarter 40.9 35.2 27.7 22.3 nep nep\n3rd Quarter 63.1 39.7 55.8 30.7 nep nep\n4th Quarter 41.8 25.0 39.6 30.9 nep nep\nFull Year $ 201.0 $ 201.0 $ 154.3 $ 154.3 nep nep\nOther Commentary\nAcquisition Rollover & Divested Operations' Total Revenues - Brokerage Segment\nActual\n(in millions) 1st Quarter 2021 2nd Quarter 2021 3rd Quarter 2021 4th Quarter 2021\n1st Quarter 2020 Acquisition Activity 2.5 NA NA NA\n2nd Quarter 2020 Acquisition Activity 4.0 2.0 NA NA\n3rd Quarter 2020 Acquisition Activity 2.6 3.0 2.0 NA\n4th Quarter 2020 Acquisition Activity 24.8 22.0 32.0 12.0\n1st Quarter 2021 Acquisition Activity 18.3 22.0 25.0 22.0\n2nd Quarter 2021 Acquisition Activity NA 5.0 7.0 8.0\nLess: Divestitures (2) (3.1) (4.0) (3.0) (3.0)\nTotal - Acquisitions & Divestitures $ 49.1 $ 50.0 $ 63.0 $ 39.0\nNotes\n(1) Values for 2021 represent forecasted revenue for acquisitions completed by June 16, 2021.

GALLAGHER & CO. - CFO COMMENTARY - JUNE 17, 2021\nThe quarterly GAAP accounting for Gallagher’s tax advantaged clean energy investments is complex, but generally requires: (a) operating expenses associated with producing clean‐\ncoal to be recognized in the period of production; (b) tax benefits relating to (a) to be recognized in the period of production; but (c) associated tax credits to be recognized as a\ncomponent of the tax provision based on the proportion of that quarter’s consolidated reported pretax earnings to expected total consolidated reported annual pretax earnings, with\ncertain modifications and without anticipation of future acquisitions.\nThe accounting for Gallagher’s tax advantaged clean energy investments reflects a considerable amount of estimation, including tax credits to be produced for the full year, annual\nGAAP earnings and the seasonal spread of GAAP earnings between each quarter. After adopting the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, Gallagher’s reported first quarter\nearnings from its core operations is higher than in the remaining three quarters of the year. This can result in a substantial number of tax credits being recognized in the first quarter\nfor GAAP purposes, even before the tax credits being recognized have been produced. The following table shows credits produced compared to tax credits recognized for the first\nquarter of 2021, and full years 2020 and 2019.\n2019 Actual 2020 Actual\nEstimates (1)\n2021 Actual\nPage 7\nThis communication is subject to, and you are urged to carefully read, the cautions set forth at the beginning of this communication.\nKey Transaction Terms\nTransaction Structure\nPurchase Price\nFinancing\nIntegration\nEarnings Impact\nRequired Approvals\nTiming\nEstimated Quarterly Impact of Pre‐Acquisition Interest Expense and Costs(legal, consulting and other professional fees)\nCORPORATE SEGMENT\n$ millions 2nd Q 2021 3rd Q 2021 4th Q 2021 Year 2021\nInterest Expense, net of tax $4m $9m $9m $22m\nPre‐acquisition costs, net of tax $9m ‐ $12m nep nep nep\nTotal $13m ‐ $16m $9m $9m nep\nDiluted Net Earnings (Loss) per Share $(0.06) ‐ $(0.08) ($0.04) ($0.04) nep\nEstimated Quarterly Share Count\nOTHER\nmillions 2nd Q 2021 3rd Q 2021 4th Q 2021 Year 2021\nDiluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding*** 206 212 212 208\nYellow highlighted rows will be presented as adjustments to GAAP earnings.\nnep = no estimate provided\nPro forma acquired operations estimated 9% to 11% accretive to Gallagher’s 2020 adjusted GAAP EPS excluding earnings from clean energy investments**\nEuropean Commission, U.S. Department of Justice and other regulatory approvals, including regulatory approvals related to the pending Aon plc and Willis\nTowers Watson plc combination and potential remedies\nTo be determined\n* “Breakage” represents Gallagher’s estimate of revenues and associated expenses reported in the acquired operations’ 2020 unaudited financial information associated with business that has been lost since December 31, 2020\nplus an estimate for clients that may not renew before the transaction closes and during the integration period and the departure of key brokers and other employees.\n** A reconciliation of 2020 adjusted EPS excluding earnings from clean energy investments can be found in the investor presentation posted May 12, 2021\n*** Reflects the May 17, 2021 common stock offering of 9 million shares and the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase 1.35 million additional shares.

Forward-looking statements convey Wabash National Corporation's (the \"Company\") current expectations or\nforecasts of future events. All statements contained in this presentation other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, all statements regarding the\nCompany’s outlook for trailer and truck body shipments, backlog, expectations regarding demand levels for trailers, truck bodies, non-trailer equipment and our other diversified product offerings, pricing, profitability and earnings, cash flow and\nliquidity, opportunity to capture higher margin sales, new product innovations, our growth and diversification strategies, our expectations for improved financial performance during the course of the year and our expectations with regards to\ncapital allocation. These and the Company’s other forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied by the forward-looking statements. Without\nlimitation, these risks and uncertainties include a continued or prolonged shutdown or reduction of our operations, substantially reduced customer orders or sales volumes and supply disruptions due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the\ncontinued integration of Supreme into the Company’s business, adverse reactions to the transaction by customers, suppliers or strategic partners, uncertain economic conditions including the possibility that customer demand may not meet our\nexpectations, increased competition, reliance on certain customers and corporate partnerships, risks of customer pick-up delays, shortages and costs of raw materials including the impact of tariffs or other international trade developments,\nrisks in implementing and sustaining improvements in the Company’s manufacturing operations and cost containment, dependence on industry trends and timing, supplier constraints, labor costs and availability, customer acceptance of and\nreactions to pricing changes and costs of indebtedness. Readers should review and consider the various disclosures made by the Company in this presentation and in the Company’s reports to its stockholders and periodic reports on Forms\n10-K and 10-Q.\nWe cannot give assurance that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. All written and oral\nforward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by the factors we disclose that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations.\nIn addition to disclosing financial results calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the financial information included in this presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures, including\noperating EBITDA, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow, adjusted segment EBITDA, and adjusted segment EBITDA margin. These non-GAAP measures should not be\nconsidered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures and results calculated in accordance with GAAP, including net (loss) income, and reconciliations to GAAP financial statements should be carefully evaluated.\nOperating EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, impairment and other, net, and other non-operating income and expense. Management believes providing operating\nEBITDA is useful for investors to understand the Company’s performance and results of operations period to period with the exclusion of the items identified above. Management believes the presentation of operating EBITDA, when combined\nwith the GAAP presentations of operating income (loss) and net income (loss), is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of the Company’s operating performance. A reconciliation of operating EBITDA to net income (loss) is included in the\nappendix to this presentation.\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. Management believes providing free cash flow is useful for investors to understand the Company’s performance and results of cash\ngeneration period to period with the exclusion of the item identified above. Management believes the presentation of free cash flow, when combined with the GAAP presentations of cash provided by operating activities, is beneficial to an\ninvestor’s understanding of the Company’s operating performance.A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash (used in) provided by operating activities is included in the appendix to this presentation.\nAdjusted operating income (loss), a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes certain costs, expenses, other charges, gains or income that are included in the determination of operating income (loss) under U.S. GAAP, but that management\nwould not consider important in evaluating the quality of the Company’s operating results as they are not indicative of the Company’s core operating results or may obscure trends useful in evaluating the Company’s continuing activities.\nAccordingly, the Company presents adjusted operating income (loss) excluding these special items to help investors evaluate our operating performance and trends in our business consistent with how management evaluates such\nperformance and trends. Further, the Company presents adjusted operating income (loss) to provide investors with a better understanding of the Company’s view of our results as compared to prior periods.A reconciliation of adjusted operating\nincome (loss) to operating income (loss), the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is included in the appendix to this presentation.\nAdjusted net loss (2020) and adjusted earnings per basic (2020) share reflect adjustments for non-cash impairment and the related tax effects of these adjustments. Management believes providing adjusted measures and excluding certain\nitems facilitates comparisons to the Company’s prior year periods and, when combined with the GAAP presentation of net loss and basic (2020) net income loss per share, is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of the Company’s\nperformance.

The statements in this presentation are made as of the date of this\npresentation, even if subsequently made available by Howmet Aerospace on its website or otherwise. Howmet Aerospace disclaims any intention or obligation to\nupdate publicly any forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\nImportant Information\n2\nImportant Information (continued)\n3\nOn April 1, 2020, Arconic Inc. completed the separation of its businesses into two independent, publicly-traded companies: Howmet Aerospace\nInc. (the new name for Arconic Inc.) and Arconic Corporation. The historical results of the businesses that comprise Arconic Corporation are\npresented as discontinued operations in Howmet Aerospace’s consolidated financial statements (other than cash flows, equity and comprehensive\nincome related to Arconic Corporation, which have not been segregated and are included in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows and\nStatement of Consolidated Comprehensive Loss, respectively). Income statement values shown in this presentation are on the basis of continuing\noperations only, and exclude the effects of discontinued operations. The calculation of adjusted free cash flow is on the basis of continuing and\ndiscontinued operations.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nSome of the information included in this presentation is derived from Howmet Aerospace’s consolidated financial information but is not presented in Howmet\nAerospace’s financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Certain of these data\nare considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. These non-GAAP financial measures supplement our GAAP disclosures and should not be considered\nan alternative to the GAAP measure. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and management’s rationale for the use of the nonGAAP financial measures can be found in the Appendix to this presentation. Howmet Aerospace has not provided reconciliations of any forward-looking non-GAAP\nfinancial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted earnings per share (or earnings per share excluding\nspecial items), to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because such reconciliations are not available without unreasonable efforts due to the\nvariability and complexity with respect to the charges and other components excluded from the non-GAAP measures, such as the effects of foreign currency\nmovements, equity income, gains or losses on sales of assets, taxes, and any future restructuring or impairment charges. These reconciling items are in addition to\nthe inherent variability already included in the GAAP measures, which includes, but is not limited to, price/mix and volume. Howmet Aerospace believes such\nreconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors.\n“Adjusted free cash flow” is cash provided from (used for) operations, less capital expenditures, plus cash receipts from sold receivables. Any reference to historical\nEBITDA means adjusted EBITDA for which we have provided calculations and reconciliations in the Appendix. \nQ1 2021 Highlights\n4\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\n• Record Q1 Adj Free Cash Flow of ($4M)4\nincluding ($41M) working capital use and ($24M) severance cash costs\n• Q1 2021 Ending Cash balance of $1.24B including early redemption of April 2021 notes for ~$360M\n• Completed early redemption of February 2022 notes for ~$500M on May 3rd 2021\n1) Income from Continuing Ops (GAAP): Q1 2020 = $153M, Q4 2020 = $106M, Q1 2021 = $80M 2) Operating income (GAAP): Q1 2020 = $258M, Q4 2020 = $221M, Q1 2021 = $189M\n3) EPS from Continuing Ops (GAAP): Q1 2020 = $0.35, Q4 2020 = $0.24, Q1 2021 = $0.18 4) Cash used for operations = ($6M), Cash used for financing activities = ($368M), Cash provided from investing\nactivities = $3M See appendix for reconciliations\nRevenue and Profitability Excluding Special Items1\nQ1 2020 Q4 2020 Q1 2021\nRevenue $1.634B $1.238B $1.209B\nAdjusted EBITDA1 $385M $282M $275M\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin1 23.6% 22.8% 22.7%\nAdjusted Operating Income2 $314M $215M $208M\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations3 $0.44 $0.21 $0.22\nQ1 2021 Above Expectations; Strong Profit and Cash Performance\n5\nPrice Increase /\nCost Reduction /\nCash Management\nMarkets\n▪ Price increases continued in line with expectations primarily tied to long term agreements\n▪ Structural cost reductions maintained with $61M benefit\n▪ Segment Decremental margins of 27% driven by price, variable cost flex and fixed cost management\n▪ Capex of $55M; less than Depreciation and Amortization of $68M\n▪ Adj Free Cash Flow less seasonal; Cash generation expected in Q2, Q3 and Q4 2021\n▪ Q1 2021 Revenue same as Q2 – Q4 2020 average driven by declines in Commercial Aerospace\n▪ Commercial Aerospace down (52%) due to customer inventory corrections\n▪ Defense Aerospace up 12% driven by Joint Strike Fighter new builds and spares\n▪ Industrial Gas Turbines up 35% driven by new builds and spares\n▪ Commercial Transportation up 15% despite customer supply chain constraints\nComparisons are year over year unless otherwise noted.

For the quarter\nended December 31, 2020, the special items relate primarily to a $53 cost to reverse indemnification receivables as a result of a favorable Spanish tax case which relieved Alcoa Corp. and Arconic Corp. of their\nshare of the liability, a $9 cost for a reserve related to investment tax credits, and other net charges of $1, offset by a ($19) net benefit for insurance proceeds related to fires at two plants. For the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2021, the special items relate primarily to net costs related to fires at two plants of $10, offset by the favorable tax impact resulting from the difference between the Company's consolidated estimated\nannual effective tax rate and the statutory rate applicable to special items ($3).\n(3) The tax impact on Special items is based on the applicable statutory rates whereby the difference between such rates and the Company’s consolidated estimated annual effective tax rate is itself a Special item.\n21\nReconciliation of Operational Tax Rate\n($ in millions)\nQuarter ended March 31, 2021\nAs reported Special items (1)(2) As adjusted\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes $113 $19 $132\nProvision for income taxes $33 $3 $36\nOperational tax rate 29.2% 27.3%\nOperational tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure.
